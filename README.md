What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
RAG is a method that combines retrieval and generation to deliver more accurate and context-aware chatbot responses. The retrieval process pulls relevant documents from a knowledge base, while the generation process uses a language model to create a coherent response based on the retrieved content. This ensures your chatbot can answer questions using the most recent data, even if the language model itself hasnâ€™t been specifically trained on that information.
