That aside, we expect a certain number of Ford customers to be swayed by the prominent front-fender badges that say, "Triton V-10," sort of the late-Nineties' equivalent of the Sixties' muscle-car hood scoop, although the majority of customers would likely find the standard 5.4-liter V-8 to be plenty adequate. The V-10 provides right-respectable acceleration in this 6360-pound dualie—0 to 60 mph took 10.1 sec­onds, and the quarter-mile went by in 17.7 seconds at 77 mph. Our last 7.5-liter V-8 F-350 dualie ran 17.3 seconds to 60 mph and 20.5 at 65 mph in the quarter-mile in February 1991.
